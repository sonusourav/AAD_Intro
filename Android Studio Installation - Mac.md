## Installation on Mac Platform

### To install Android Studio on your Mac, proceed as follows:
1. Launch the Android Studio DMG file.
2. Drag and drop Android Studio into the Applications folder, then launch Android Studio.
3. Select whether you want to import previous Android Studio settings, then click OK.
4. The Android Studio Setup Wizard guides you through the rest of the setup, which includes downloading Android SDK components that are required for development. Further steps are similar to **Windows Installation** and can be found [here](https://github.com/oss2019/HelloAndroid/blob/master/Android%20Studio%20Installation%20-%20Windows.md).
